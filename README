This is a simplified version of the date range picker developed by filammentgroup.

It allows users to select a range date using the faimiliar Jquery Date Picker Control. It is useful 
when there is only space for one input box for both the from and to dates 


The Date Range Picker contains only 2 options 
1. Specific Date
2. Clear

Changes done to the Position Function to ensure that it positions itself based on the given AppendTo (Parent) relative to the body of the page.

Extras:
When used with a  jqgrid... you need to increase the height of the grid on the onOpen event so that the date range picker is visible.
